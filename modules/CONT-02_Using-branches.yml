        - Every day you will be editing files on your project or adding new files.
        - You don't want to take risks with the code on your master branch so you need to create a branch.
        - When you create a branch, you are essentially creating an identical copy of the project at that point in time that is completely separate from the master branch.
        - This keeps your the code on your master branch safe while you experiment and fix issues.
        - Let's learn how you can create a new branch.

      video-script:
        - do: Navigate to the `class repository`
          say: Earlier you created an issue to create an introduction file. Let's create a branch that you will use to add your file.
        - do: Click the branch dropdown
          say: You can create a branch by clicking on the `branch dropdown`.
        - do: Enter the branch name 'firstname-lastname-intro'
          say: And entering a branch name in the text field.
        - do: Press `Enter`
          say: "When you press Enter, you are automatically switched to the `firstname-lastname-intro` branch. Now, any changes you make to the files in the repository will be applied to this new branch."
        - do: Go to another repo and then return to the class repo
          say: "However, a word of caution. When you leave the repository and come back, notice that GitHub automatically assumes you want to see the items on the master branch."
        - do: Click the branch dropdown and reselect the branch
          say: "If you want to continue working on your branch, you will need to reselect it using the branch dropdown. Now you are ready to create your own branch and start adding some commits."
