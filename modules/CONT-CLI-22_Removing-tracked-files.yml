        - do: "Type `ls -lr`"
          say: "Sometimes we need to remove a file that is already being tracked. We could just delete the file and then stage and commit the change. But let's use a shortcut to delete our conflict.md file."
        - do: "Type `git rm conflict.md`"
          say: "We can use the git rm command, followed by the file we would like to delete."
        - do: "Type `git status`"
          say: "When we type git status, we can see that the file has already been staged and is ready for us to commit."
        - do: "Type `git commit -m\"remove conflict file\"`"
          say: "Now we simply need to commit the change."
