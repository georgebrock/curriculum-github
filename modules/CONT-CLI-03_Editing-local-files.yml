        - "Now that you have cloned the repository and checked out your branch, you are ready to make some changes to the local files. If you are familiar with using the command line to open and edit files, then much of this will be familiar to you. The only difference here is that we will be making our changes on a branch. Let's add more information to the bio we created earlier."

          say: "First, let's double check that we are on the correct branch."
        - do: Type `cd bios`
          say: "Technically you could just open the file with the Finder window or Windows Explorer, but let's stay purely on the command line for now and cd into the bios folder. "
        - do: Type `atom <file-name.md>`
          say: "I am going to modify my file in atom, so I will use the command line to open atom and the file all at once. You can use your favorite text editor to make changes to your file. "
        - do: Type changes in the file
          say: Add more information about yourself to the end of the original file.
        - do: Click `Save > Quit`
          say: "When you are finished, save the file and close the text editor. "
        - do: Open the CLI
          say:  Let's go back to the terminal window and take a look at what we have just done.
        - do: Type `git checkout master`
          say: Go back to the terminal window and checkout the master branch.
        - do: Type `atom <file-name.md>`
          say: "When you open your file with the master branch selected, you will notice that the changes you just made to the file are not included. "
        - do: Open the CLI
          say: Now go back to your terminal window
        - do: Type `git checkout <your branch>`
          say: And check out your branch again.
        - do: Type `atom <file-name.md>`
          say: "And open the file. Now that you are on your branch, the changes appear again."
